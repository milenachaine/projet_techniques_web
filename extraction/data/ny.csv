"An  art museum  or  art gallery  is a building or space for the  exhibition of art , usually  visual art .
Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection.  Paintings  are the most commonly displayed  art objects ; however,  sculptures ,  decorative arts , furniture, textiles,  costumes ,  drawings ,  pastels ,  watercolors ,  collages ,  prints ,  artist's books ,  photographs , and  installation art  are also regularly shown. [1]   Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as  performance arts , music concerts, or  poetry  readings.
