<item><url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theater</url><title>Musical theatre</title><content>Musical theatre  is a form of  theatrical  performance that combines songs, spoken  dialogue , acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical – humor,  pathos , love, anger – are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like  opera  and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply,  musicals .

<item><url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Early_Music_Festival</url><title>Boston Early Music Festival</title><content>The  Boston Early Music Festival  ( BEMF ) is a non-profit organization founded in 1980 in  Boston , Massachusetts, U.S. to promote  historical music performance .  It presents an annual concert series in Boston and  New York City , produces opera recordings, and organizes a weeklong Festival and Exhibition every two years in Boston. A centerpiece of these festivals has been a fully staged Baroque opera production.
One of BEMF’s main goals is to unearth lesser-known Baroque operas, which are then performed by the world’s leading musicians armed with the latest information on period singing, orchestral performance, costuming, dance, and staging at each biennial Festival. BEMF operas are led by the BEMF Artistic Directors Paul O’Dette and Stephen Stubbs, BEMF Orchestra Director Robert Mealy, and BEMF Opera Director Gilbert Blin. In 2008, BEMF introduced its Chamber Opera Series as part of its annual concert season. The series presents semi-staged productions of chamber operas composed during the Baroque period. In 2011, BEMF took its chamber production of Handel’s  Acis and Galatea  on a four-city North-American tour. In 2004, BEMF initiated a project to record some of its work in the field of Baroque opera on the CPO recording label. The series has since earned five Grammy Award nominations, including a 2015 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.
