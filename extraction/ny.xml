Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply,  musicals .

A museum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection.  The process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called  accessioning  and each object is given a unique  accession number .
